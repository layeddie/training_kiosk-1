# Build smart touchscreen kiosks with Nerves and Phoenix

This is the result of the "Build Smart TouchScreen Kiosks with Nerves and
Phoenix" training session day at the ElixirConf 2018.

The training session was given by Justin Schneck (a.k.a `@mobileoverlord`) and
Frank Hunleth (a.k.a `@fhunleth`) and we did a lot of fun stuff like:

* Nerves basic concepts
* Development environment setup
* Creating and burning a firmware into SD Card
* Boot Raspberry Pi 3 B+ with Nerves included
* Start an IEx session via SSH
* Build a touch screen that runs Chromium, add Phoenix Channels

The original `training_kiosk` project was published by Justin and can be found
here:

https://github.com/mobileoverlord/training_kiosk

Probably you should look at that project instead of this one for a more recent
version, I just tried to type along the training session, except the JavaScript
bits which I copy & paste from the slides.
